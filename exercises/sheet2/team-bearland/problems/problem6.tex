\textbf{\textit{(6) The permutohedron $\Pi^{n-1}$ is the convex hull of all $n!$ permutations of the vector $(1,2,\dots,n)$. For $n\ge3$, show that $\dim\Pi^{n-1}=n-1$, that $f_{n-2}(\Pi^{n-1}) = 2^n-2$, and $f_1(\Pi^{n-1}) = \tfrac12 (n-1)n!$. If you like, show that $f_k(\Pi^{n-1}) = k!\{{n\atop k}\} = \sum_{i=0}^k(-1)^i\binom{k}{i}(k-i)^n$.}}
