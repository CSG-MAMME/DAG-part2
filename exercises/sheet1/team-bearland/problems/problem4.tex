\hspace{5pt}\textbf{\textit{(a) Let $G=(V,E)$ be a bipartite graph with color classes $V_1,V_2$. For $i=1,2$, let $M_i$~be the matroid where $I\subseteq E$ is independent if and only if each vertex in~$V_i$ is covered by at most one edge in~$I$. Use the Matroid Intersection Theorem to prove:}}
    \begin{theoremstar}[K\H onig's Matching Theorem]
      The maximum size of a matching in a bipartite graph equals the minimum size of a vertex cover.

Use the Matroid Intersection Theorem to prove that there exists a rainbow spanning tree (a spanning tree all of whose edges are colored differently) if and only if $G-F$ has at most $t+1$ connected components, for any union~$F$ of $t$~colors, for any $t\ge0$.}}
