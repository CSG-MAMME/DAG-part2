\textbf{\textit{(8) We have seen that a matroid can be given by its collections of independent sets, bases, circuits, cocircuits, flats, or its rank function. Find algroithms to convert between as many of these entitites as you can. What is their combinatorial complexity?}}

For the rest of the exercise, it will be useful having the following graph in mind.
We will refer to specific algorithms by the letter of their edge.
In doing so, we won't assume anything on our ground set, neither on a theoretical implementation, we will just focus on the combinatorial complexity.
Note that we have chosen this \textit{bipartite} representation to improve readability.

Beneath we describe each algorithm indexed by the label of the edge and include its complexity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] 
        We have that a set is independent if and only if it is a subset of a basis.
        In other words, a basis is a maximaly independent set.
        To obtain $\B$ from $\I$ we iteratively, add independent elements to our basis with the caveat that subsets of already existing elements are discarded, and elements containing an already included one are swapped.
        The combinatorial complexity is $\mathcal{O}(|\I|^2)$.
    \item[(b)] Symetrically, $\I$ is the power set of $\B$, from which the algorithm clearly follows. The complexity is ruled by printing or returning all elements in the set, which is $\mathcal{O}\left(2^{|\B|}\right)$.
    \item[(c)] THINK
    \item[(d)] As proven in class, finding the dual of a matroid is linear in its size (doing Gauss). Further, given that the cocricuits are the circuits of the dual matroid, to obtain the cocircuits we can find the dual of the matroid (lineal time) and then apply (c).
    \item[(e)] A circuit is a minimally dependent set, all its proper subsets are independent. If we are given $\B$, we have to check whether adding a new element of $E$ creates a circuit or not. Note that, $\forall x \in E, \B \cup x$ contains one circuit but we want to make sure that it is minimally dependent. The algorithm consists then in for each $B \in \B = {x_1, \dots, x_b}$ and for each $x \in E$ we generate a circuit $C$ consisting of $x \cup \lbrace x_i : x_i \in B \wedge B \cup \{ x\} - x_i \in \B \rbrace$. The algorithm's complexity is then $\mathcal{O}\left(|\B||E||B|\right)$\footnote{E. Minieka, \textit{Finding the Circuits of a Matroid}. Journal of research of the National Bureau of Standards.}.
