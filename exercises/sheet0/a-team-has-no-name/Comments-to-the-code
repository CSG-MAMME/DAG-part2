1)Our code could eventually process all the files, but for the file with more than 3000 elements in the base it took 19 thousand seconds which are more than 5 hours.
2)If n is the number of elements in B and m the max number of elements in any of the elements of B, our python code runs in O(n³)*O(m⁴). We could reduce the complexity concerning m, but as in almost any case we can find m is going to be a constant amount compared to n, we have not worried a lot about it as the complexity for those kinds of general examples is actually O(n³). We tried to reduce this complexity by trying to check relations between the elements in B but at first we ended up making the complexity worse, and then when improved we returned back to O(n³) but reducing the running time to a 60%-70% of the original one for the files we processed.
