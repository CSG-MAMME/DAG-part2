\section{Execution times}

\subsection{Team Bearland}

We implemented a mask-based algorithm.
Each mask $m$ represents a set.
The $i$-th bit of the mask is set to 1 iff $i$ belongs to the set.
We can easily, and in a fast manner, access each position shifting bits, and unions, intersections and complements are solved using bitwise OR, AND, NOT, and XOR operators.
The code implemented in \textsc{Python3}, albeit leveraging the same principle, implements the masking operations differently.
 
In both cases, the complexity is the same. We take advantage of the fact that all values in all inputs are integers between $0$ and $r - 1 = 19$. In every case, we build the masks in $\mathcal{O}(\sum_{B \in \mathcal{B}} |B|) = \mathcal{O}(r|\mathcal{B}|)$ time. Then, for each pair $(B_1, B_2) \in \mathcal{B} \times \mathcal{B}$, we check that the exchange conditions by taking all $\mathcal{O}(r)$ values of $x \in B_1$, and checking if the condition holds for each of the $\mathcal{O}(r)$ possible values of $y \in B_2$, and we also check that $x \in B_1 \setminus B_2$ and $y \in B_2 \setminus B_1$ in $\mathcal{O}(r^2)$ time. Finally, we check that the mask for $B_1 \setminus \{x\} \cup \{y\}$ belongs to the set of masks in $\mathcal{O}(\log(|\mathcal{B}|))$ time. Therefore, the total complexity is $\mathcal{O}(r |\mathcal{B}|) + \mathcal{O}(r^2 |\mathcal{B}|^2| \log(|\mathcal{B}|)) =  \mathcal{O}(r^2 |\mathcal{B}|^2| \log(|\mathcal{B}|))$.

Figure~\ref{fig:team-bearland-times} summarizes the execution times for both programming languages.
Note that we re-ordered the results to plot them in a, more or less, increasing fashion.

    \caption{Execution time of the two different implementations in increasing order.\label{fig:team-bearland-times}}
\end{figure}
The results were to be expected, the compiled, performance-oriented, \textsc{C++} implementation outruns the \textsc{Python3} one by two orders of magnitude.
However, we do observe that the behaviour, the pattern described by execution times as we increase the load (\textit{i.e.} the complexity) is the same for both algorithms.
This is a great example not to underestimate the constants affecting our expected running time, usually disregarded by complexity theory and big $\mathcal{O}$ notation.
%Under our point of view, each programming language has it's 

\subsection{Tresplans}

The complexity of the two algorithms is not the same. In the case of the \textsc{Python} code, we have a complexity of $O(N^2)$ where $N$ is the number of bases:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Process file: $O(N)$.
 \item Compare bases: $O(N^2)$.
 \item Compare each pair of subsets of the base: contsant time with a large constant.
\end{itemize}
\\
In the case of the \textsc{C} code, we have a complexity of $O(N^3)$ where $N$ is the number of bases:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Process file: $O(N)$.
 \item Compare bases: $O(N^2)$.
 \item Compare each pair of subsets of the base: $O(N)$ with a large constant.
\end{itemize}
