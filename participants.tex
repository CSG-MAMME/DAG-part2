\section*{Carlos Segarra}

%A short cv here. For example, you could write about the following:
My name is Arnau Mir and I am a student enrolled in \textit{Graph Theory}, \textit{Discrete and Algorithmic Geometry}, \textit{Number Theory} and \textit{Commutative Algebra}.

Formally, I curse a degree in Mathematics at University of Balear Islands, and I am here to improve my techniques on attacking problems of advanced mathematics.
.

Moreover, I really enjoy programming, but i only have the background that can be obtained cursing my degree.
In particular, I used Java and Python.


In this course, I expect to gain a greater insight into how geometry problems and other computational problems are solved.
I'm only interested in the part that allows me to mature as a mathematician.

I have not thought about what my future job will be, I just hope to become a better mathematician.

\section*{Next name}

A short cv here. For example, you could write about the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item What kind of math have you studied?
\item What kind of math would you like to learn?
\item What programming projects have you done or would like to do?
\item What do you expect from this course?
\item Where do you want to be in three years' time? In five?
\end{itemize}
