\section*{Carlos Segarra}

%A short cv here. For example, you could write about the following:
My name is Carlos Segarra and I am a student enrolled in \textit{Graph Theory}, \textit{Discrete and Algorithmic Geometry}, and \textit{Concurrency, Parallelism, and Distributed Systems} from the Master in Research in Informatics (\href{https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics}{MIRI-UPC}).

Formally, I hold a BSc in Mathematics and one in Electrical Engineering by the \textit{Centre de Formaci\'o Interdisciplin\`aria Superior} (\href{https://cfis.upc.edu}{CFIS-UPC}), and I am looking forward to strengthen my knowledge in discrete mathematics and cryptography.
For any further reference, CV, or other social media handles you can visit my \href{https://carlossegarra.com}{website}.

Moreover, I really enjoy programming, and this is in fact what I spent most of my days doing (also as a day-job).
In particular, I am well-versed in \textsc{C}, and \textsc{Python}.
But I have also worked with JVM-based languages like \textsc{Java} and \textsc{Scala}, other scripting languages like \textsc{bash}, and other more esoteric programming languages like \textsc{Erlang}, and \textsc{Haskell}. 
On a side note, I really like \TeX and \texttt{vim}, so I can give a hand with that if needed.
To check out a subset of the projects I am working on you can visit my \href{https://github.com/csegarragonz}{Github}.

In this course, I expect to gain a greater insight into how geometry problems are solved and applied to real world scenarios.
However, I expect this focus on applications not to come at the expense of mathematical rigor and correctness.
%without losing perspective on the correctness and theory begind the concepts we deploy.
It is this link between computer science and mathematics that I look forward to exploiting in the coming years as a PhD in the area of distributed systems, networking, and security.

\section*{Arnau Mir}
My name is Arnau and I am an student enrolled in \textit{Graph Theory}, \textit{Discrete and Algorithmic Geometry}, \textit{Number Theory} and \textit{Commutative Algebra}

I obtained a degree in Mathematics by the University of Balearic Islands. On the one hand, I have to say that my background in geometry was obtained coursing Euclidian Geometry, Affine Geometry, Differencial Geometry and Topological Geometry.
On the other hand, I have a little background programming with lenguages like Java and Python, but I only spend one year improving my skills in both lenguages. 
I hope that in this subject I can improve my techniques to solve problems related to geometry, I have a special interest in the theoretical vision of these problems.

In relation to my future, I'm not sure which branch of mathematics I want to work on but  I am very motivated to learn new techniques to attack advanced math problems and I think the best option would be to take a PHD.

\item What programming projects have you done or would like to do?
\item What do you expect from this course?
\item Where do you want to be in three years' time? In five?
\end{itemize}
