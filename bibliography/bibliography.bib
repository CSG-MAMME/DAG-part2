 annotate={This book introduces into the world of convex polytopes in $d$-dimensional affine spaces. It is developed from a course for advanced studies, and the reader can notice the author's successful didactical effort and enthusiasm for this subject.

Famous in the theory of polytopes is the classical treatment of \textit{L. Schläfli} [`Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität' (1850-1852), Gesammelte Math. Abh. Vol. 1, Birkhäuser Basel, pp. 167-387 (1949; Zbl 0035.21902)]. The modern theory was established by \textit{B. Grünbaum} [`Convex polytopes', Interscience, London (1967; Zbl 0163.16603)]. Using these concepts and results here, now the author gives an excellent introduction to some basic methods and furthermore modern tools of polytope theory. Except for the basics in chapter 0 and 3 the lectures of the book are essentially independent from each other and require only a basic background knowledge of real affine geometry and of vector spaces. Especially, we find a concentration on combinatorial aspects of the theory. In every chapter the author shows important and interesting figures to illustrate his text, and he also tries to visualize the geometry of higher dimensional polytopes. At the end of each of the ten chapters there are interesting notations, problems, exercises, and historical comments. A good book to study geometry of polytopes and to give pleasure in this field! This expressed aim of the book has been doubtlessly achieved. It will be useful for both students and lecturers, for it can serve as an easy to read but nevertheless profound textbook on polytopes.

The titles of the ten chapters (and some subchapters) are: 0. Introduction and examples. 1. Polytopes, polyhedra and cones (Fourier- Motzkin elimination, Farkas lemma, Carathéodory's theorem). 2. Faces of polytopes (Face lattice, polarity, simplicial and simple polytopes). 3. Graphs of polytopes. 4. Steinitz' theorem for 3-polytopes. 5. Schlegel diagrams for 4-polytopes. 6. Duality, Gale diagrams and applications (Vector configurations, oriented matroids, polytopes with few vertices, rigidity, universality theorem). 7. Fans, arrangements, zonotopes, and tilings (Minkowski sums, nonrealizable oriented matroids, zonotopal tilings). 8. Shellability and the upper bound theorem (Euler-Poincaré formula, Dehn-Sommerville equations, upper bound theorem from McMullen, some extremal set theory, Kruskal-Katona theorem, Macaulay's theorem). 9. Fiber polytopes, and beyond.

At the end of the book we find references to nearly 500 titles on this subject.

 annotate={This is an introduction to the field of discrete geometry understood as the investigation of combinatorial properties of configurations of (usually finitely many) geometric objects, like arrangements of points or hyperplanes or, more generally, convex sets. Some emphasis is laid on asymptotic results which are relevant for estimating the complexity of geometric algorithms. Certain areas of discrete geometry are neglected intentionally, such as the theory of packing and covering. Besides fundamental facts on convex sets, lattice points, and so on, the book deals with the following themes: combinatorial complexity of geometric configurations, intersection patterns and transversals of convex sets, geometric Ramsey theory, polyhedral combinatorics and high-dimensional convexity (including for instance a discussion of volumes in high dimensions and Dvoretzky's theorem on almost spherical sections), embedding of finite metric spaces into normed spaces. All needed concepts and tools are well explained, in particular the more advanced ones like Gale diagrams, Davenport-Schinzel sequences, and Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension.

Even some of the more complicated proofs are given in full detail. At the end of each section a comprehensive survey on historical and recent results is presented.

There are also many well-selected exercises, classified according to their difficulty. For some of the exercises hints are given in an appendix.

The book is written in a lively and stimulating but very precise style and contains many figures. It gives a good impression of the richness and the relevance of the field. At the end of the book there is a short summary of each chapter.}

The authors ``firmly believe that understanding the fundamentals of geometry and combinatorics pays up for algorithms and applications'' of triangulations, and this interplay is beautifully developed.

After introductory examples, setting up language and basic constructions, and a concrete chapter on computational geometry in dimension two, the book discusses Gelfand--Kapranov--Zelevinsky's central theorem on secondary polytopes (whose face lattices realize the posets of regular subdivisions of point configurations), followed by important families of configurations and triangulations (e.g., cyclic polytopes, product of simplices, 0/1-polytopes), a chapter on computation and algorithms, and a chapter on further topics (including fiber polytopes, mixed subdivisions, lattice polytopes, Gröbner bases and polytopal complexes).

The writing is thorough and engaging, assisted by clear (and numerous) illustrations, and many exercises for the reader. Graduate students and researchers in any area in which triangulations of points set configurations play a role will find this book a comprehensive and most useful reference.

 annotate={This book is a comprehensive exposition of oriented matroids consisting of ten chapters. It is intended for graduate students as an introduction (where some knowledge in discrete mathematics is of advantage) and for researchers who need a thorough reference work.

The book starts with two orientation sessions which illustrate different aspects of oriented matroids. Since oriented matroids can be thought of as combinatorial abstraction of directed graphs, of real hyperplane arrangements, of point configurations, and of convex polytopes, these mathematical theories are used to motivate oriented matroids. In these two chapters a number of examples is presented and simultaneously the main concepts and terminology of oriented matroids is introduced.

In the third chapter a formal introduction is given by presenting four basic axiom systems for oriented matroids: circuit axioms, orthogonality axioms, chirotopes, and vector axioms. These axiom systems arise from directed graphs, orthogonal pairs of real vector subspaces, point configurations and convex polytopes, and real hyperplane arrangements, respectively. Other topics discussed in this chapter include minors, duality, and local realizability.

Chapter 4 is entitled ``From Face Lattices to Topology''. Face lattices are studied in this chapter in a general axiomatized version. The lattices are formed by the covectors of an oriented matroid under a natural partial ordering. The connection to topology is established by showing that the covector lattice of an oriented matroid uniquely determines a regular cell decomposition of a sphere.

In Chapter 5
topological models for oriented matroids are presented. The core of this chapter is the Topological Representation Theorem. It says that general oriented matroids similarly correspond to arrangements of generalized hyperplanes, each obtained from a flat hyperplane by tame topological deformation. The rank 3 case of the Topological Representation Theorem can easily be visualized. In the projective version, this identifies rank 3 oriented matroids with arrangements of pseudolines. These arrangements are the topic of Chapter 6.

In Chapter 7
it is discussed how oriented matroids can be extended, deformed, locally perturbed, flipped, glued together, and how the old and the newly obtained oriented matroids are related. The realizability of oriented matroids is the topic of Chapter 8. To this for the space R(M) of all vector realizations of a fixed oriented matroid M is introduced. The realizability problem for M now becomes the question whether the semialgebraic variety R(M)

is empty or not.

Chapter 9
is devoted to the combinatorial theory of convex polytopes. Several new results on polytopes as well as new simplified proofs for known results could be found with the help of oriented matroid theory. Chapter 10

gives an introduction to linear programming on oriented matroids. A geometric access to the fundamental ideas of oriented matroid programming, as developed by Bland is given.

A list of open problems and exercises is included after each of the ten chapters. In the second edition an appendix has been added about some current frontiers of research. Here, the progress made since the first edition was published is summarized. Also the already excellent bibliography of the first edition has been greatly expanded.}

 annotate={Schrijver's 3 volumes on combinatorial optimization reflect the current state of the art in this field, in particular from the viewpoint of polyhedral combinatorics and efficient algorithms. Less emphasis is put on advanced data structures, approximative, randomized and parallel algorithms, semidefinite programming and graph decomposition.

The book offers a masterly introduction with many interesting historical remarks as well as an in-depth survey of combinatorial optimization. It is divided into eight main parts with 83 chapters. The main parts are (I) paths and flows, (II) bipartite matching and covering, (III) nonbipartite matching and covering, (IV) matroids and submodular functions, (V) trees, branchings and connectors, (VI) cliques, stable sets and colouring, (VII) multiflows and disjoint paths and, finally, (VIII) hypergraphs. Volume A contains an introduction, preliminaries and the first three main parts. Volume B contains the main parts (IV)-(VI), and Volume C contains the last two parts, a survey of open problems, over 4500 references for further research and name and subject indices.

The reader is supposed to have a basic knowledge of graph theory and linear as well as integer programming. The author gives short and elegants proof to all main results. In order to keep the overall size of the volumes under control, the topics applications and modelling of optimization problems, and computational methods for NP-hard problems are not treated.

The first part of the book, devoted to paths and flows, starts with a description of various shortest paths methods. Thereafter it discusses disjoint paths giving several proofs for Menger's theorem, and continues with maximum flows, circulations and transshipments. Furthermore, the following topics are treated: path and flow polyhedra and total unimodularity, Dilworth's theorem and connectivity algorithms, in particular the Gomory-Hu tree.

The second part starts with bipartite matchings (giving several proofs of Königs and Frobenius' theorems). Then the linear assignment problem is discussed with many historical remarks. The bipartite matching polytope, bipartite edge cover and stable sets, bipartite edge-colouring and transversals are further topics of part (II). A particular emphasis is put on b-matching and transportation problems with interesting information about early investigations in the former Soviet Union.

The third part is devoted to nonbipartite matching and covering and discusses in detail the pioneering work of Tutte and Edmonds. The first chapter in this part is devoted to non-bipartite cardinality matching, again with detailed historical remarks. Then the matching polytope is studied and algorithms for the weighted nonbipartite matching problem are treated. Further chapters deal with edge-colourings (Vizing's theorem), the Chinese postman problem, T-cuts and T-joins, 2-matching, 2-cover and 2-factor problems, b-matchings, bidirected graphs, the perfect matching polytope and the perfect matching lattice.

Volume B starts with matroids. Again detailed historical remarks are given which demonstrate the development of this notion. The chapter finds its classical continuation with the greedy algorithm and the independent set polytope. The next chapters treat matroid intersection problems and algorithms, matroid union and matroid matching. Then submodular functions and polymatroids are introduced and a strongly polynomial-time algorithm for finding the minimum of a submodular function is described. Finally, the author deals with polymatroid intersection, Dilworth truncation and closes this part with generalizations of submodular functions based on lattice families, intersecting families and crossing families.

Part (V) is devoted to trees, branchings and connectors. It starts with a chapter on shortest spanning trees and the corresponding historic background. Then the packing and covering of trees is treated. Moreover, trees in directed graphs are considered, namely branchings and arborescences. Further chapters deal with biconnectors and bibranchings, minimum directed cut covers and the packing of directed cuts as well as with strong connectors. Chapter 58 describes the basics of the travelling salesman problem together with extensive historical notes and a detailed list of further references. Finally, matching forests and submodular functions on directed graphs are investigated. Further chapters deal with graph orientation problems, network synthesis and connectivity augmentation.

Part (VI) is devoted to problems which are NP-hard in general,namely cliques, stable sets and colourings. In the case of perfect graphs these problems become polynomially solvable. Therefore perfect graphs are treated in detail and many interesting historical remarks are provided. Moreover, it is shown that a maximum-weighted stable set and a minimum weight clique cover in a perfect graph can even be found in strongly polynomial time. Finally, T-perfect graphs and claw-free graphs are considered.

Volume C starts with part (VII) on multicommodity flows and disjoint paths. After discussing the basic properties, the two commodity case is treated. Then it is investigated to which extent Hu's theorem can be generalized to three or more commodities. In the next chapter the T-path problem and Mader's theorem is analyzed. This problem becomes particularly interesting in planar graphs which are treated in Chapter 74. In particular, Okamura's theorem is proved. Further chapters deal with cuts, odd circuits and multicommodity flows and graphs on surfaces where an interesting homotopic circulation theorem is proved.

The last part of this compendium is devoted to hypergraphs and their relation to matching, vertex cover, edge cover and the stable set problem. Starting from packing and blocking problems in hypergraphs, the author describes ideal, Mengerian and binary hypergraphs and gives the short proof of Guenin for Seymour's characterization of binary Mengerian hypergraphs. Then a survey on relations between matroids and multicommodity flows in hypergraphs is given. Moreover, stable sets and edge covers in hypergraphs are studied. Finally, balanced and unimodular hypergraphs are introduced and studied.

These three volumes contain an immense richness of results up to 2002 and will prove to be indispensible for any further research in the field of combinatorial optimization.}

Prepared for an advanced undergraduate course, it is aimed to present recent developments in the theory of convex polytopes, which are centered around secondary and state polytopes arising from point configurations.

The text consists of 14 chapters. Chapters 1--3 are devoted to some fundamental geometric and algebraic notions from the theory of polytopes. Chapters 4--6 deal with the representations of $n$-polytopes in terms of the well-known Schlegel diagrams and Gale diagrams. Point configurations in $\RR^n$
and their triangulations are analyzed in details in Chapter 7. The next Chapter 8, the soul of the book, is devoted to the secondary polytopes of point configurations. As a concrete example of secondary polytopes, the permutahedron is described in Chapter 9. Fundamental relations between secondary polytopes and state polytopes of toric ideals of point configurations are established in Chapters 10--14. The theory of Gröbner bases, where the notion of state polytopes arises naturally, is developed in Chapters 10--12. Connections between Gröbner bases of toric ideals and regular triangulation of point configurations defining ideals are discussed in Chapter 13. In the final Chapter 14 the author demonstrates how to construct state polytopes of toric ideals naturally related to secondary polytopes. The theory of secondary and state polytopes is a recently developed direction of the modern geometry, which has numerous applications to combinatorics, algebraic geometry, discrete geometry, etc.

Moreover, the text itself is clearly written and self-contained, numerous illustrations and exercises are included. Thus, this ``Lectures in geometric combinatorics'' may be undoubtedly recommended for undergraduate and graduate students as a textbook on modern aspects of the theory of polytopes.}

The book describes data structures derived from various definitions for ``oriented matroid'' and Haskell routines to navigate from one data structure to another, as well as routines to produce the dual or minors of a given oriented matroid, to produce the graphic oriented matroid of a given graph, and so forth. Then these tools are employed to study questions of combinatorial topology and geometry, such as ``Given a (particular) triangulation of the 3-dimensional sphere, can it be realized as the poset of faces of the boundary of a convex 4-dimensional convex polytope?''

Several instances of this question are answered, with the aid of more specialized Haskell code. For the sphere problem and many others, a two-step process is used: First decide whether or not the sphere triangulation can be realized as an oriented matroid polytope; then, if so, decide whether or not the oriented matroid(s) found can be realized by matrices. Other applications are considered; in particular, a later chapter considers the realizability of subdivisions of the torus and of surfaces of higher genus by geometric polygons in space. The complete Haskell code is included, documented, and used to help with explanations of the mathematical content. A short Haskell tutorial is included in an appendix.

For illustrative purposes, the book contains not only a large number of colorful pictures of oriented matroids, but also pictures of artwork, by various artists, all having oriented matroid themes; the book, itself, is perhaps a piece of art.}
